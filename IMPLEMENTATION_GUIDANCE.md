- **Updated `latinContent.ts`** with correct titles, descriptions, and icons matching source material

### Authentic Thema Structure Implemented

8. **Thema VIII**: First and Second Conjugations - Verb family comparison
9. **Thema IX**: Nouns - The Dative Case - Indirect objects
10. **Thema X**: Nouns - The Ablative Case - Basic usage patterns

## Next Steps for Complete Implementation

### 1. Question Content Alignment (High Priority)

**Current Issue**: Existing questions in `thema1.ts` through `thema10.ts` don't match the authentic curriculum.

**Required Action**: Each Thema's questions need to be rewritten to match the extracted content:

- **Thema 1**: Should focus on sum/es/est forms and personal pronouns (ego, tu, nos, vos)
- **Thema 2**: Should focus on 1st conjugation only (amo, ambulo, canto, etc.)
- **Thema 3**: Should introduce nominative case and PAIN exceptions
- **Thema 4**: Should focus on accusative case and direct objects
- **Thema 5**: Should introduce neuter gender and 2nd declension neuters
- **Thema 6**: Should focus on adjective agreement (bonus/bona/bonum pattern)
- **Thema 7**: Should focus on genitive case and possession
- **Thema 8**: Should introduce 2nd conjugation verbs (video, moneo, habeo)
- **Thema 9**: Should focus on dative case and indirect objects
- **Thema 10**: Should focus on basic ablative usage

### 2. Vocabulary Integration

**Reference Source**: Use the vocabulary lists from `AUTHENTIC_10_THEMAS_EXTRACTED.md`

**Implementation**: Each Thema's questions should primarily use vocabulary from that Thema and previous ones, following the authentic progression.

### 3. Age-Appropriate Complexity

**Key Principle**: All content must be accessible to 10-year-old students.

**Guidelines**:
- Simple sentence structures
- Clear pattern recognition
- Gradual complexity increase
- Consistent reinforcement of previous concepts
- Visual and contextual clues where possible

### 4. Cultural Context Integration

**Source Material**: The original curriculum includes cultural information that should be preserved.

**Implementation**: Questions should occasionally include cultural context about Roman life, mythology, and history as presented in the source material.
