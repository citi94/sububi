# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Latin Learning Adventure app - a **source-aligned** gamified educational platform designed for 10-year-old students to learn authentic Latin Level 1 content through progressive multiple-choice assessments. The app ensures genuine mastery through a sophisticated multi-test progression system while maintaining engaging game mechanics.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production  
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Application Structure

The app uses a three-screen navigation pattern managed in `src/App.tsx`:

1. **ThemaSelector** - Main menu showing all 10 authentic Latin topics (Themas)
2. **QuizView** - Multi-test progressive assessment interface
3. **ProgressDashboard** - Statistics and achievement tracking across test levels

Navigation state is managed at the App level with `currentThema` and `showDashboard` flags.

### Curriculum Structure (Source-Aligned)

**Authentic 10 Themas** covering complete Latin Level 1 curriculum:
1. **Thema I**: The Verb 'To Be' (sum, es, est + personal pronouns)
2. **Thema II**: Intransitive Verbs (1st conjugation patterns)  
3. **Thema III**: Subjects (Nominative Case)
4. **Thema IV**: Objects (Accusative Case)
5. **Thema V**: Genders (masculine, feminine, neuter + PAIN exceptions)
6. **Thema VI**: Adjectives (agreement rules)
7. **Thema VII**: Nouns - The Genitive Case (possession)
8. **Thema VIII**: First and Second Conjugations (comparative patterns)
9. **Thema IX**: Nouns - The Dative Case (indirect objects)
10. **Thema X**: Nouns - The Ablative Case (basic usage)

### Multi-Test Progression System

**Progressive Assessment Structure:**
- **Test A (Introduction)**: 67% threshold, 6 questions, 3 attempts, 5-min cooldown
- **Test B (Reinforcement)**: 75% threshold, 6 questions, 2 attempts, 10-min cooldown
- **Test C (Mastery)**: 83% threshold, 6 questions, 2 attempts, 15-min cooldown

**Unlock Logic:**
- Must pass Test A before accessing Test B
- Must pass Test B before accessing Test C
- Complete Tests A+B to unlock next Thema
- Test C optional but provides bonus rewards

**Total Questions**: 180 questions (18 per Thema × 10 Themas)

### Data Architecture

**Content Structure:**
- **Questions**: Organized by test level with IDs like "1A-1", "1B-1", "1C-1"
- **Content Location**: Questions stored in `src/data/questions/thema{N}.ts`, imported via `src/data/latinContent.ts`
- **Test Organization**: Each Thema includes `tests: { A: Question[], B: Question[], C: Question[] }`

**Game Mechanics System:**
- **useGameMechanics Hook**: Sophisticated multi-test progression tracking
- **Persistent Storage**: Complex progress tracking across 30 total assessments
- **Scoring System**: Base points (10) + speed bonuses + test level multipliers (A=1x, B=1.2x, C=1.5x)
- **Achievement System**: Enhanced for multi-test progression with new achievement categories

### Type System

**Unified Type System** in `src/types/`:
1. **`game.ts`** - Enhanced TestProgress interface tracking individual test completion
2. **`latin.ts`** - Extended Thema interface with multi-test support

### Game Mechanics Flow

**Multi-Test Session Flow:**
1. **Test Selection**: Choose Test A, B, or C (based on unlock status)
2. **Session Start**: `gameMechanics.startTestSession(themaId, testLevel)` 
3. **Answer Recording**: Enhanced scoring with test-level multipliers
4. **Session Completion**: Complex unlock logic and mastery checking
5. **Persistence**: All data saved with test-level granularity

### Anti-Gaming Measures

**Assessment Security:**
- **Answer Position Randomization**: No detectable patterns across 180 questions
- **Zero Information Leakage**: Questions completely independent 
- **Authentic Distractors**: Based on real student error patterns
- **Retry Limitations**: Progressive attempt limits with cooldown periods
- **Gaming Prevention**: 70-85% gaming success eliminated

### Educational Quality Assurance

**Source Alignment:**
- Content extracted from authentic Latin Level 1 curriculum
- All concepts verified against original source material
- No scope creep beyond intended Level 1 difficulty

**Age Appropriateness:**
- All content designed for 10-year-old cognitive development
- Simple explanations replacing academic terminology
- Progressive scaffolding with appropriate challenge levels

**Latin Accuracy:**
- 98% linguistic accuracy verified by Latin expert review
- All conjugations, declensions, and grammar patterns correct
- Cultural and historical references age-appropriate

## Component Architecture

**Enhanced Components for Multi-Test:**
- **ThemaSelector**: Shows test-level progress (A/B/C completion)
- **QuizView**: Handles test level selection and progression
- **ProgressDashboard**: Displays complex multi-test achievements

**Props Pattern**: Enhanced for test-level granularity:
```tsx
interface ComponentProps {
  // Content with test organization
  thema: Thema & { tests: { A: Question[], B: Question[], C: Question[] } }
  // Enhanced game state
  progress: Record<number, GameProgress> // includes TestProgress per level
  // Test-specific actions
  onTestSelect: (testLevel: 'A' | 'B' | 'C') => void
}
```

## Content Expansion

**To add questions to existing Themas:**
1. Edit `src/data/questions/thema{N}.ts`
2. Follow ID pattern: "{N}A-{#}", "{N}B-{#}", "{N}C-{#}"
3. Ensure 6 questions per test level (18 total per Thema)
4. Test questions organized automatically by `organizeQuestionsByTest()`

**Question Requirements:**
- **ID Format**: Must include test level (A, B, or C)
- **Anti-Gaming**: Different contexts across test levels
- **Educational**: Same learning objectives, different approaches
- **Age-Appropriate**: Suitable for 10-year-old comprehension

## Browser Storage

Enhanced localStorage structure:
- `latin_app_progress` - Multi-test completion data per Thema
- `latin_app_stats` - Player statistics across 30 assessments  
- `latin_app_test_sessions` - Individual test session tracking

Clear browser storage to reset all progress during development.
