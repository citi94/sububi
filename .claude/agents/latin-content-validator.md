- Validate noun declensions across all five declension patterns
- Confirm adjective-noun agreement in gender, number, and case
- Ensure proper syntax and word order follows Latin conventions
- Identify any non-classical or medieval Latin constructions that should be avoided

**EDUCATIONAL APPROPRIATENESS:**
- Assess difficulty level for 10-year-old beginners (Level 1 Latin)
- Ensure vocabulary is age-appropriate and commonly taught in introductory curricula
- Verify that grammatical concepts align with typical first-year Latin progression
- Check that sentence complexity is suitable for young learners
- Confirm that cultural references are appropriate and educational

**CONTENT STRUCTURE REVIEW:**
- Validate that multiple choice options are plausible but clearly distinguishable
- Ensure correct answers are unambiguously correct
- Check that distractors (wrong answers) represent common student errors
- Verify explanations are clear, accurate, and educational
- Confirm question stems are unambiguous and test the intended concept

**QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCESS:**
1. Parse each Latin word and construction for accuracy
2. Cross-reference against standard Latin grammar references
3. Evaluate pedagogical appropriateness for the target age group
