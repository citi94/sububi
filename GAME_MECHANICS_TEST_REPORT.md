## Detailed Test Analysis

### 1. Scoring Algorithm Validation âœ…

**Purpose:** Verify point calculation accuracy across all game scenarios

**Key Findings:**
- âœ… Base points (10) correctly awarded for correct answers
- âœ… Speed bonuses properly calculated (max 5 bonus points for fast answers)
- âœ… Test level multipliers function correctly (A=1.0x, B=1.2x, C=1.5x)
- âœ… Streak bonuses apply appropriately (1.2x per streak level, capped at 3x)
- âœ… Incorrect answers correctly result in 0 points

**Sample Calculations Verified:**
```
Fast answer (1s), Test A: 10 + 5 speed + 0 streak Ã— 1.0 = 15 points
Streak 3, Test B: 10 + 4 speed Ã— 3 streak Ã— 1.2 = 50 points  
Maximum combo, Test C: 10 + 5 speed Ã— 3 streak Ã— 1.5 = 67 points
```
